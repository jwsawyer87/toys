# Toys documentation

Select a toy to learn more about it.  I use _Bruno's Favorite_ to indicate that a tool is very useful and practical, a few times a week ir not at least once a day!

| Tool | Bruno's Favorite? | Brief Description |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [`banner`](banner.md) | Yes | Prints text in a _banner_ |
| [`bashprofiles`](bashprofiles.md) | | Prints profile script(s) `bash` will use |
| [`beeper`](beeper.md) | | Beeps over and over. |
| [`bingrep`](bingrep.md) | | Searches for a regular expression in arbitrary data from stdin |
| [`br`](br.md) | Yes | Browse a file.  Sounds simple?  Maybe, but give it a try. |
