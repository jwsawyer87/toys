# Bruno's Toys
This is a collection of Unix tools command line that make my life easier.  I think others might like them too so I'm making them available here but the repository is just a nice way for me to keep track of changes and deploy them easily to systems.

I will admit that the documentation is rather poor for some of the tools and many of them have little or more comments.  This is a work in progress - I'm constantly creating new tools and improving documentation.  In November 2017, I did a major overhaull of the documentation because I was disatisfed with having a huge table.  I'm liking the results so far.

## Documentation for each important tool

Select a tool below to learn more about it.  I use _Bruno's Favorite_ to indicate that a tool is:
- very useful and practical
